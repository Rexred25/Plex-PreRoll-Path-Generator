This program will generate a text file named "PreRoll Path.txt" after the user selects a folder containing files that they would like to use as prerolls within Plex. Requires .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime and will prompt to install if the runtime doesn't exist on the PC.

The text within the PreRoll Path.txt file will be on one single line and look similar to:

C:/Users/username/Videos/preroll_1.mp4;C:/Users/username/Videos/preroll_2.mp4;C:/Users/username/Videos/preroll_3.mp4;C:/Users/username/Videos/preroll_4.mp4;
